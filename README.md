# Introduction to Computer Vision: Plant Seedlings Classification ðŸŒ¿

## Project Overview
In the pursuit of modernizing agriculture and reducing manual labor, our project leverages the power of Computer Vision and Deep Learning to classify plant seedlings. With a dataset provided by the Aarhus University Signal Processing group and the University of Southern Denmark, this project aims to distinguish between 12 different plant species based on images, thereby aiding agricultural workers and researchers in quick and accurate plant identification.

## Problem Statement
The manual process of identifying plant seedlings is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This project seeks to automate the classification of plant seedlings into 12 distinct species using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), streamlining the process for efficiency and accuracy.

## Dataset Description
The dataset comprises images of unique plant seedlings categorized into 12 species. Due to large data volume, images have been pre-processed into numpy arrays (`images.npy`), with corresponding labels stored in `Labels.csv`.

### Species Classification
- Black-grass
- Charlock
- Cleavers
- Common Chickweed
- Common Wheat
- Fat Hen
- Loose Silky-bent
- Maize
- Scentless Mayweed
- Shepherds Purse
- Small-flowered Cranesbill
- Sugar beet

## Methodology
1. **Data Pre-Processing**: Standardized image sizes and performed image augmentation to enhance the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized data to understand distribution and characteristics of each species.
3. **Model Building**: Developed CNN models to classify seedlings, with layers designed to capture the complex patterns in plant images.
4. **Model Performance Improvement**: Iteratively refined the model using techniques like dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting and improve accuracy.
5. **Final Model Evaluation**: Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the validation set.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python for scripting
- TensorFlow and Keras for building and training CNN models
- NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Google Colab for leveraging GPU acceleration

## Final Model and Performance
The final CNN model achieved remarkable accuracy in classifying the plant seedlings. (Include specific metrics and performance details here.)

## Actionable Insights and Business Recommendations
1. **Automation in Plant Classification**: Implement the model in mobile applications for real-time seedling classification, reducing manual labor.
2. **Precision Agriculture**: Use the model to monitor crop health and weed presence, allowing for targeted interventions.
3. **Data Collection and Analysis**: Continuously collect data to further refine the model and uncover insights into plant growth patterns and health.
